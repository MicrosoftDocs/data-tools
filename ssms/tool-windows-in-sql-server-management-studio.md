[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

 SQL Server Management Studio provides many powerful tool windows for all phases of development and administration. Some tools can be used on any [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] component, and others are for certain components only. The following table identifies the tools that can be used for all components of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
|Tool|Purpose|

| [Object Explorer](object/object-explorer.md) | Browse servers, create and locate objects, manage data sources, and view logs. This tool is accessed from the **View** menu.|  
| [Solution Explorer](solution/solution-explorer.md) | Store and organize scripts and related connection information in projects called [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Scripts. You can store several [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Scripts as Solutions and use source control to manage scripts as they evolve over time. This tool is accessed from the **View** menu. |
