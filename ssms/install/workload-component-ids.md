# Workload and component IDs for SQL Server Management Studio

Installing SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) using a command line requires workload and component IDs. These IDs allow you to select what to install, modify, or uninstall. Uninstalling SSMS entirely requires channel IDs.

This article is laid out as follows:

- The first section includes the channel ID for each release of SSMS.

- Each workload has its own section, followed by the workload ID and a table of the components that are available for the workload.

- By default, the required components are installed when you install the workload.

- If you choose to, you can also install the Recommended and Optional components.

For more information about how to use these IDs, see [Use command-line parameters to install SQL Server Management Studio](command-line-parameters.md).
