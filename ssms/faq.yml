          It doesn't matter. SSMS is installed in a separate location that you can select in the installer.

      - question: "What can I do with SSMS?"
        answer: |
          SSMS is a Visual Studio-based solution, and offers an integrated experience when working with SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse Analytics. SSMS makes the core experiences that you rely on every day simple and easy with built-in features such as multiple tab windows, a rich SQL query editor, IntelliSense, keyword completion, code snippets, and source control integration (Git). You can execute queries on-demand, view, and save results as text or CSV, edit data, and browse database objects in object explorer.

          SSMS offers a consistent experience to back up and restore your databases. With support for SQL Server Always On availability groups, you can easily configure, monitor, and troubleshoot availability groups for your mission-critical SQL Server databases and quickly failover to a secondary database during a disaster. SSMS has been designed to make you more productive in the DevOps lifecycle of your databases of choice on the operating systems of your choice. As a result, you're always in control, and you can reduce risks, solve problems faster, and continuously deliver value that exceeds customers' expectations.

      - question: "Is SSMS open source?"

          No.

      - question: "Do you plan to make SSMS open source?"
        answer: |
          No.

      - question: "Are extensions supported in SSMS?"
        answer: |
          Bringing extensions to SSMS is a multi-step process. It starts with supporting Microsoft internal extensions, such as the new migration extension, SSIS and SSAS, and GitHub Copilot in SSMS. These first-party extensions appear in the Visual Studio Installer as individual components.

          While SSMS currently doesn't have full support for third-party extensions, we don't block third-party extensions. That means that existing extensions can be updated to work with SSMS without any restrictions. However, we still don't officially support them, and any items requesting help on the [feedback site](https://aka.ms/ssms-feedback) will be closed.

          We're investigating official support, which includes VSIX support, extension management, and a marketplace presence, but there are no timelines to share currently. You can expect updates as we make progress.
