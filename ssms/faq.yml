          While SSMS 21 currently doesn't have full support for third-party extensions, we don't block third-party extensions. That means that existing extensions can be updated to work with SSMS 21 without any restrictions. However, we still don't officially support them, and any items requesting help on the [feedback site](https://aka.ms/ssms-feedback) will be closed.
          We are investigating official support, which includes VSIX support, extension management, and a marketplace presence, but there are no timelines to share currently. We will announce updates as we make progress.
