SSMS runs on Windows (Intel or AMD x86-64) processors only. If you need a tool that runs on platforms other than Windows, take a look at Azure Data Studio. Azure Data Studio is a cross-platform tool that runs on macOS, Linux, as well as Windows. For details, see [Azure Data Studio](/azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio).
