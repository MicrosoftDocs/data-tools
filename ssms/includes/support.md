## Support or troubleshooting

Sometimes, things can go wrong. If your SSMS installation fails, see [Troubleshoot installation and upgrade issues for SQL Server Management Studio](../install/troubleshoot.md) for step-by-step guidance.

You can reference the [SSMS Developer Community](https://aka.ms/ssms-feedback) site for other known issues (filter on **Tooling** under **Groups**) and to provide feedback to the product team.
