# Delete a SQL Server Agent Proxy
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

This topic describes how to delete a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent proxy account in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using SQL Server Management Studio or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)].

### <a name="Restrictions"></a>Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   When you delete a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent proxy account, make sure the proxy does not reference any active job steps. To check for any job steps that reference the proxy, right-click the proxy, select **Properties**, and then, in the _proxy\_name_**Proxy Account Properties** dialog box, select the **References** page. If you delete a proxy, you are given the option to reassign all job steps that use that proxy in the **Delete Object** dialog box.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent proxies use credentials to store information about Windows user accounts. The user specified in the credential must have "Log on as a batch job" permission on the computer on which [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is running.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent checks subsystem access for a proxy and gives access to the proxy each time the job step runs. If the proxy no longer has access to the subsystem, the job step fails. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent impersonates the user that is specified in the proxy and runs the job step.  
  
-   If the login for the user has access to the proxy, or the user belongs to any role with access to the proxy, the user can use the proxy in a job step.  
  
### <a name="Security"></a>Security  
  
#### <a name="Permissions"></a>Permissions  
Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can create, modify, or delete proxy accounts.  
  
## <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a>Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To delete a SQL Server Agent proxy account  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, click the plus sign to expand a server that contains the proxy account that you want to delete.  
  
2.  Click the plus sign to expand **SQL Server Agent**.  
  
3.  Click the plus sign to expand the **Proxies** folder.  
  
4.  Click the plus sign to expand the subsystem that contains the proxy account you want to delete (for example, **ActiveX Script)**.  
  
5.  Right-click the proxy account that you want to delete and select **Delete**.  
  
6.  In the **Delete Object** dialog box, confirm that the correct proxy account is selected. Check the **Reassign to** check box to reassign the job steps that reference this proxy account to another account.  
  
7.  Click **OK**.  
  
## <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a>Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To delete a SQL Server Agent proxy account  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- deletes the proxy "Catalog application proxy"  
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
    EXEC dbo.sp_delete_proxy  
        @proxy_name = N'Catalog application proxy' ;  
    GO  
    ```
