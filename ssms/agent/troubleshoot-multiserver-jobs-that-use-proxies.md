# Troubleshoot Multiserver Jobs That Use Proxies
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

[!INCLUDE [sql-server-agent-azure-sql-managed-instance-support](../includes/sql-server-agent-azure-sql-managed-instance-support.md)]

Distributed jobs whose steps are associated with a proxy run under the context of the proxy account on the target server. If job steps that use proxy accounts fail when downloaded from the master server, check the **error_message** column in the **sysdownloadlist** table in the **msdb** database for the following error messages:  
  
-   "The job step requires a proxy account, however proxy matching is disabled on the target server."  
  
    To resolve this error, set the **\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.**_\<n\>_**\SQLServerAgent\AllowDownloadedJobsToMatchProxyName** registry subkey to **1 (true)**. By default, this subkey is set to **0** (**false**). The value of **MSSQL.**\<*n*> is the instance name; for example, **MSSQL.1** or **MSSQL.3**.  
  
-   "Proxy not found."  
  
    To resolve this error, make sure a proxy account exists on the target server with the same name as the master server proxy account under which the job step runs.
