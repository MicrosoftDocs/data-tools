# Write the Job Status to the Windows Application Log

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

This topic describes how to configure [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to write job status to the Windows application event log by using SQL Server Management Studio, [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)], or SQL Server Management Objects.  
  
Job responses ensure that database administrators know when jobs complete and how frequently they run. Typical job responses include:  
  
-   Notifying the operator by using e-mail, electronic paging, or a **net send** message. Use one of these job responses if the operator must perform a follow-up action. For example, if a backup job completes successfully, the operator must be notified to remove the backup tape and store it in a safe location.  
  
-   Writing an event message to the Windows application log. You can use this response only for failed jobs.  
  
-   Automatically deleting the job. Use this job response if you are certain that you do not need to rerun this job.

#### To write job status to the Windows application log  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, expand **Jobs**, right-click the job you want to edit, and then click **Properties**.  
  
3.  Select the **Notifications** page.  
  
4.  Check **Write to Windows application event log**, and choose one of the following:  
  
    -   Click **When the job succeeds** to log the job status when the job completes successfully.  
  
    -   Click **When the job fails** to log the job status when the job completes unsuccessfully.  
  
    -   Click **When the job completes** to log the job status regardless of completion status.  
  
## <a name="SMO"></a>Using SQL Server Management Objects  
**To write job status to the Windows application log**  
  
Call the **EventLogLevel** property of the **Job** class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell.  
  
The following code example sets the job to generate an operating system event log entry when the job execution finishes.  
  
**PowerShell**  
  
```  
$srv = new-object Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server("(local)")  
$jb = new-object Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Agent.Job($srv.JobServer, "Test Job")  
$jb.EventLogLevel = [Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Agent.CompletionAction]::Always  
```
