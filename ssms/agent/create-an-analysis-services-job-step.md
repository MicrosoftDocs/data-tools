# Create an Analysis Services Job Step

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Managed Instance from SQL Server](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

This topic describes how to create and define [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent job steps in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that execute [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Analysis Services commands and queries by using SQL Server Management Studio, [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] or SQL Server Management Objects.

    [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMS)

    [SQL Server Management Objects](#SMO)  
  
## <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a>Before You Begin  
  
### <a name="Restrictions"></a>Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   If the job step uses an Analysis Services command, the command statement must be an XML for Analysis Services **Execute** method. The statement may not contain a complete Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) envelope or an XML for Analysis **Discover** method. While SQL Server Management Studio supports complete SOAP envelopes and the **Discover** method, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent job steps do not. For more information about XML for Analysis Services, see [XML for Analysis Overview (XMLA)](/previous-versions/sql/).  
  
-   If the job step uses an Analysis Services query, the query statement must be a multidimensional expressions (MDX) query. For more information about MDX, see [MDX Statement Fundamentals (MDX)](/analysis-services/multidimensional-models/mdx/mdx-query-fundamentals-analysis-services?viewFallbackFrom=sql-server-ver15).  
  
### <a name="Security"></a>Security  
  
#### <a name="Permissions"></a>Permissions  
  
-   To run a job step that uses the Analysis Services subsystem, a user must be a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role or have access to a valid proxy account defined to use this subsystem. In addition, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service account or the proxy must be an Analysis Services administrator and a valid Windows domain account.  
  
-   Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can write job step output to a file. If the job step is run by users who are members of the **SQLAgentUserRole** database role in the **msdb** database, then the output can be written only to a table. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent writes job step output to the **sysjobstepslog** table in the **msdb** database.  
  
-   For detailed information, see [Implement SQL Server Agent Security](implement-sql-server-agent-security.md).  
  
## <a name="SSMS"></a>Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To create an Analysis Services command job step  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, create a new job or right-click an existing job, and then click **Properties**. For more information on creating a job, see [Create Jobs](create-jobs.md).  
  
3.  In the **Job Properties** dialog box, click the **Steps** page, and then click **New**.  
  
4.  In the **New Job Step** dialog box, type a job **Step name**.  
  
5.  In the **Type** list, click **SQL Server Analysis Services Command**.  
  
6.  In the **Run as** list, select a proxy that has been defined to use the Analysis Services Command subsystem. A user who is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can also select **SQL Agent Service Account** to run this job step.  
  
7.  Select the **Server** where the job step will run, or type the server name.  
  
8.  In the **Command** box, type the statement to execute, or click **Open** to select a statement.  
  
9. Click the **Advanced** page to define options for this job step, such as what action [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent should take if the job step succeeds or fails, how many times the job step should be attempted, and where the job step output should be written.  
  
#### To create an Analysis Services query job step  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, create a new job or right-click an existing job, and then click **Properties**. For more information on creating a job, see [Create Jobs](create-jobs.md).  
  
3.  In the **Job Properties** dialog, click the **Steps** page, and then click **New**.  
  
4.  In the **New Job Step** dialog, type a job **Step name**.  
  
5.  In the **Type** list, click **SQL Server Analysis Services Query**.  
  
6.  In the **Run as** list, select a proxy that has been defined to use the Analysis Services Query subsystem. A user who is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can also select **SQL Agent Service Account** to run this job step.  
  
7.  Select the **Server** and the **Database** where the job step will run, or type the server or database name.  
  
8.  In the **Command** box, type the statement to execute, or click **Open** to select a statement.  
  
9. Click the **Advanced** page to define options for this job step, such as what action [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent should take if the job step succeeds or fails, how many times the job step should be attempted, and where the job step output should be written.  
  
## <a name="TSQL"></a>Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To create an Analysis Services command job step  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.
