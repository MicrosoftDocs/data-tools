# Edit an Operator
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

[!INCLUDE [sql-server-agent-azure-sql-managed-instance-support](../includes/sql-server-agent-azure-sql-managed-instance-support.md)]

This topic describes how to edit an operators' availability for receiving notifications and their e-mail, pager, and net send addresses in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using SQL Server Management Studio or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)].

### <a name="Restrictions"></a>Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   The Pager and **net send** options will be removed from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent in a future version of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Avoid using these features in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use these features.  
  
-   Note that SQL Server Agent must be configured to use Database Mail to send e-mail and pager notifications to operators. For more information, see [Assign Alerts to an Operator](assign-alerts-to-an-operator.md).  
  
-   SQL Server Management Studio provides an easy, graphical way to manage jobs, and is the recommended way to create and manage the job infrastructure.
