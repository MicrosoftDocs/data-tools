# Create a Schedule
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

You can create a schedule for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using SQL Server Management Studio, [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)], or SQL Server Management Objects.

-   **To create a schedule, using:**  
  
    [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMS)  
  
    [Transact-SQL](#TSQL)  
  
    [SQL Server Management Objects](#SMO)

#### To create a schedule  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, right-click **Jobs**, and select **Manage Schedules**.  
  
3.  In the **Manage Schedules** dialog box, click **New**.  
  
4.  In the **Name** box, type a name for the new schedule.  
  
5.  If you do not want the schedule to take effect immediately after it has been created, clear the **Enabled** check box.  
  
6.  For **Schedule Type**, select one of the following:  
  
    -   To start the job when the CPUs reach an idle condition, click **Start whenever the CPUs become idle**.  
  
    -   If you want a schedule to run repeatedly, click **Recurring**. To set the recurring schedule, complete the **Frequency**, **Daily Frequency**, and **Duration** groups on the dialog.  
  
    -   If you want the schedule to run only one time, click **One time**. To set the **One time** schedule, complete the **One-time occurrence** group on the dialog box.  
  
## <a name="TSQL"></a>Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To create a schedule  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- creates a schedule named RunOnce.   
    -- The schedule runs one time, at 23:30 on the day that the schedule is created.  
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
  
    EXEC dbo.sp_add_schedule  
        @schedule_name = N'RunOnce',  
        @freq_type = 1,  
        @active_start_time = 233000 ;  
  
    GO  
    ```

## <a name="SMO"></a>Using SQL Server Management Objects  
**To create a schedule**  
  
Use the **JobSchedule** class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell. For more information, see [SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)](/sql/relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/sql-server-management-objects-smo-programming-guide).
