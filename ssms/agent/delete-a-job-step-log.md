## <a name="SMO"></a>Using SQL Server Management Objects  
Use the **DeleteJobStepLogs** methods of the **Job** class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell. For more information, see [SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)](/sql/relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/sql-server-management-objects-smo-programming-guide).  
  
```  
-- Uses PowerShell to delete all job step log files that have ID values larger than 5.  
$srv = new-object Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server("(local)")  
$jb = $srv.JobServer.Jobs["Test Job"]  
$jb.DeleteJobStepLogs(5)  
```
