# Run Jobs
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

To manage [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs, you can use SQL Server Management Studio, [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] stored procedures, or [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects.
