# Create a Transact-SQL Job Step
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

This topic describes how to create a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent job step that executes [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] scripts in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using SQL Server Management Studio, [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)], or SQL Server Management Objects.  
  
These job step scripts may call stored procedures and extended stored procedures. A single [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] job step can contain multiple batches and embedded GO commands. For more information on creating a job, see [Creating Jobs](create-jobs.md).

#### To create a Transact-SQL job step  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, create a new job or right-click an existing job, and then click **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the **Job Properties** dialog, click the **Steps** page, and then click **New**.  
  
4.  In the **New Job Step** dialog, type a job **Step name**.  
  
5.  In the **Type** list, click **Transact-SQL Script (TSQL)**.  
  
6.  In the **Command** box, type the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] command batches, or click **Open** to select a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] file to use as the command.  
  
7.  Click **Parse** to check your syntax.  
  
8.  The message "Parse succeeded" is displayed when your syntax is correct. If an error is found, correct the syntax before continuing.  
  
9. Click the **Advanced** page to set job step options, such as: what action to take if the job step succeeds or fails, how many times [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent should try to execute the job step, and the file or table where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent can write the job step output. Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can write job step output to an operating system file. All SQL Server Agent users can log output to a table.  
  
10. If you are a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role and you want to run this job step as a different SQL login, select the SQL login from the **Run as user** list.  
  
## <a name="TSQL"></a>Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To create a Transact-SQL job step  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- creates a job step that uses Transact-SQL  
    USE msdb;  
    GO  
    EXEC sp_add_jobstep  
        @job_name = N'Weekly Sales Data Backup',  
        @step_name = N'Set database to read only',  
        @subsystem = N'TSQL',  
        @command = N'ALTER DATABASE SALES SET READ_ONLY',   
        @retry_attempts = 5,  
        @retry_interval = 5 ;  
    GO  
    ```

## <a name="SMO"></a>Using SQL Server Management Objects  
**To create a Transact-SQL job step**  
  
Use the **JobStep** class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell.
