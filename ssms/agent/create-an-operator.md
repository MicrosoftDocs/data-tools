# Create an Operator
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

This topic describes how to configure a user to receive notifications about [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using SQL Server Management Studio or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)].  
  
## <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a>Before You Begin  
  
### <a name="Restrictions"></a>Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   The Pager and **net send** options will be removed from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent in a future version of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Avoid using these features in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use these features.  
  
-   Note that SQL Server Agent must be configured to use Database Mail to send e-mail and pager notifications to operators. For more information, see [Assign Alerts to an Operator](assign-alerts-to-an-operator.md).  
  
-   SQL Server Management Studio provides an easy, graphical way to manage jobs, and is the recommended way to create and manage the job infrastructure.  
  
### <a name="Security"></a>Security

Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can create operators.

2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```

    -- from Monday through Friday from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M.  
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
  
    EXEC dbo.sp_add_operator  
        @name = N'Dan Wilson',  
        @enabled = 1,  
        @email_address = N'danwi',  
        @pager_address = N'5551290AW@pager.Adventure-Works.com',  
        @weekday_pager_start_time = 080000,  
        @weekday_pager_end_time = 170000,  
        @pager_days = 62 ;  
    GO  
    ```
