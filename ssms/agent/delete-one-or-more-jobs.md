# Delete One or More Jobs
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

This topic describes how to delete [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using SQL Server Management Studio, [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)], or SQL Server Management Objects.

2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, expand **Jobs**, right-click the job you want to delete, and then click **Delete**.  
  
3.  In the **Delete Object** dialog box, confirm that the job you intend to delete is selected.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
#### To delete multiple jobs  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**.  
  
3.  Right-click **Job Activity Monitor**, and click **View Job Activity**.

3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.

## <a name="SMO"></a>Using SQL Server Management Objects  
**To delete multiple jobs**  
  
Use the **JobCollection** class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell. For more information, see [SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)](/sql/relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/sql-server-management-objects-smo-programming-guide).
