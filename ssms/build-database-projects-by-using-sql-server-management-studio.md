# Build Database Projects by Using SQL Server Management Studio

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

A database script project is an organized set of scripts, connection information, and templates that are all associated with a database or one part of a database. Microsoft SQL Server provides the SQL Server Management Studio for administering and designing SQL Server databases within the context of a script project. SQL Server Management Studio includes designers, editors, guides and wizards to assist users in developing, deploying and maintaining databases.  
  
## SQL Server Management Studio  
SQL Server Management Studio is a suite of administrative tools for managing the components belonging to SQL Server. This integrated environment allows users to perform a variety of tasks, such as backing up data, editing queries, and automating common functions within a single interface.  
  
SQL Server Management Studio includes the following tools:  
  
-   Code Editor is a rich script editor for writing and editing scripts. SQL Server Management Studio provides four versions of the Code Editor; the Database Engine Query Editor for [!INCLUDE[tsql](includes/tsql-md.md)] scripts, the DMX Query Editor, the MDX Query Editor, and the XML/A Query Editor.  
  
-   Object Explorer for locating, modifying, scripting or running objects belonging to instances of SQL Server.  
  
-   Template Explorer for locating and scripting templates.  
  
-   Solution Explorer for organizing and storing related scripts as parts of a project.  
  
-   Properties Window for displaying the current properties of selected objects.  
  
SQL Server Management Studio supports efficient work processes by providing:  
  
-   Disconnected access. You can write and edit scripts without connecting to an instance of SQL Server.  
  
-   Scripting from any dialog box. You can create a script from any dialog box so that you can read, modify, store and reuse the scripts after you create them.  
  
-   Nonmodal dialog boxes. When you access a UI dialog box you can browse other resources in SQL Server Management Studio without closing the dialog box.  
  
## Solutions and Script Projects  
Solution Explorer is a utility to store and reopen database solutions. Solutions organize related script projects and files. Script projects store SQL Server script files, SQL templates, connection information and other miscellaneous files. When a script is saved in a script project, users are able to:  
  
-   Maintain version control on scripts.  
  
-   Store results options with a script.  
  
-   Organize related scripts in a single script project.  
  
-   Save connection information with scripts.  
  
Solution Explorer is a tool for developers who are creating and reusing scripts that are related to the same project. If a similar task is required later, you can use group of scripts that were stored in a project. If you have created applications by using Microsoft [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](includes/vsprvs-md.md)], you will find Solution Explorer very familiar.  
  
A solution consists of one or more script projects. A project consists of one or more scripts or connections. A project may also include nonscript files.
