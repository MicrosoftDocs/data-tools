# Properties Window (Management Studio)

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

Use this window to view properties of selected elements. You can also use the Properties window to view file, project, and solution properties. The Properties window is available by clicking **Properties Window** on the **View** menu.  
  
The Properties window displays different types of editing fields, depending on the needs of a particular property. Properties shown in gray are read-only.  
  
## Options  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-----------|---------------|  
|**Object name**|Lists the currently selected object or objects. Only objects from the active editor or designer are visible.|  
|**Categorized**|Lists all properties and property values for the selected object, by category. You can collapse a category to reduce the number of visible properties. When you expand or collapse a category, you see a plus (+) or minus (-) to the left of the category name. Categories are listed alphabetically.|  
|**Alphabetic**|Alphabetically sorts all design-time properties and events for selected objects.|  
|**Properties**|Displays the properties for an object.|  
|**Description pane**|The description pane appears at the bottom of the Properties window and shows the property type and a short description of the property. You can turn the description of the property off and on using the **Description** command on the shortcut menu.|
