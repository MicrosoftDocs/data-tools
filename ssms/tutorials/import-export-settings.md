The first time you open SSMS after installing a major release you are prompted to import user settings:

The **Import User Settings** dialog only appears on the first launch of a newly installed version. For example, if you have SSMS 19.3 installed on your machine and install SSMS 20.2, the dialog appears. If you have SSMS 20.1 installed and you install SSMS 20.2, the import dialog doesn't appear.

For a new installation of SSMS 20, you can import settings from SSMS 18 or SSMS 19, or not import any settings.

Choosing to import settings in this dialog only imports connection settings. After the import is complete, open the connection dialog. Within the **Server name** drop-down, you see the list of servers that exists in the version of SSMS from which you imported settings. The connection settings for each server, such as **Authentication** and **User name**, are also imported.
