# Connect to any SQL Server component from SQL Server Management Studio

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

SQL Server Management Studio provides functionality for managing every component of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Use Management Studio to connect to:

- An instance of the [!INCLUDE [ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)].

- [!INCLUDE [ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)].

- [!INCLUDE [ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)].

- [!INCLUDE [ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].

Although Management Studio allows you to work with queries without first establishing a connection to a data source, most other tasks require a connection. Management Studio provides the **Connect to Server** dialog box to configure connection properties to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components. When Management Studio starts, it opens the **Connect to Server** dialog box and prompts you to connect to a server. The **Connect to Server** dialog box retains the connection settings from the last time it was used.

> [!NOTE]  
> This feature can be turned off so no connection is automatically initiated. For more information, see [Database Engine Service startup options](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/database-engine-service-startup-options).

## Save connections

You can save connections to specific servers in Registered Servers, or you can save connections in projects with Solution Explorer.

### Save connections in Registered Servers

When you register a server, Management Studio saves the connection information in Registered Servers. To connect to a registered server, double-click the server name in Registered Servers. Object Explorer then opens a connection to the server.

### Save connections in Solution Explorer

Solution Explorer allows you to store related queries, scripts, connections, and other associated information in a project. Each script project contains a node called **Connections**, where you can save one or more connections. To add a connection, right-click **Connections**, and then select **New Connection**. To access a saved connection, expand **Connections** and double-click the connection. Management Studio opens a query window associated with that connection. When saved, scripts retain their association to a specific connection.
