# Suggest a feature or improvement for SQL Server Management Studio

Users of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) can submit requests for improvement or new functionality using the [SSMS user feedback site](https://aka.ms/ssms-feedback), or using **Help** > **Send Feedback** > **Suggest a Feature...** Submitted ideas are regularly reviewed, and SSMS users can upvote and comment on ideas they support.

When submitting a request, search the site first to see if a similar issue exists. On the **You are requesting a feature for SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** page, enter a title that concisely describes your request.

A list of similar requests is displayed. Review the existing feedback tickets to determine if there's one that describes the same request. If an existing feedback ticket exists, select **This is exactly my suggestion** to upvote the feedback item. Select **Go to details and discussion** to add a comment that describes your scenario, or provides additional information about your variation of the request.

If you can't find a similar request, include detailed information about the improvement or feature in the **Description**. Select **Submit** when finished.

## Ticket status

After you submit a suggestion for a feature or improvement, the status indicates where the submission is in its lifecycle. As we consider your feedback and move it along the workflow, we tag it with the corresponding status. The various statuses associated with feature suggestions are listed here, along with a description of their meaning.

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **New** | The suggestion is newly reported, and no action has been taken yet. |
| **Under Review** | The feature suggestion is available for prioritization. We prioritize features that bring the broader community the best value, also taking the product roadmap into consideration. Even if we're unable to pursue your new feature suggestion immediately, we continue to monitor your idea, let the community weigh in, and then make a decision on the next steps. |
| **On Roadmap** | Your feature suggestion has a broad community impact and helps improve the product experience, and we allocated time for it in our roadmap. |
| **Needs More Info** | We need more information from you so that we can better understand your suggestion. Within the comments, there's a request for information to help us obtain a deeper understanding. |
| **Closed - Duplicate** | Someone else suggested the same feature. A link is provided for you to track the original request. |
| **Closed - Not Enough Info** | After several attempts, we didn't receive enough information to understand your feature suggestion fully. We are closing the suggestion as we're unable to take any further action. |
| **Closed - Out of Scope** | When a suggestion doesn't match our overall product direction, we close it as out of scope. |
| **Closed - Other Product** | The request applies to another product. See the comment that includes the product and any related links. |
| **Completed - Preview** | The new feature is available in the latest SSMS preview. |
| **Completed - Release** | The new feature is available in the latest SSMS release. |
