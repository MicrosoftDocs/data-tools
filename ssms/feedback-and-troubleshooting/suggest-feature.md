# Suggest a feature or improvement for SQL Server Management Studio 21 Preview

Users of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) can submit requests for improvement or new functionality using the [SSMS user feedback site](https://aka.ms/ssms-feedback), or using **Help** > **Send feedback**. Submitted ideas are regularly reviewed, and SSMS users can upvote and comment on ideas they support.

When providing feedback, searching the site first is recommended to see if a similar idea exists. Expand the **Groups** menu on the feedback site and select **Tooling**. To search existing items, enter relevant text or keywords in the Search dialog.

## Idea status

After you submit a suggestion for a feature or improvement, the Stage indicates where the submission is in its lifecycle. As we consider your feedback and move it along the workflow, we tag it with the corresponding stage. The various stages associated with feature suggestions are listed here, along with a description of their meaning.

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Archived** | A status of **Archived** means the suggestion is no longer relevant to the current release, or there needs to be more community interest to keep the item active. |
| **Completed** | **Completed** indicates that your new feature suggestion is available in the latest product update. |
| **Declined** | A status of **Declined** means the suggestion doesn't match our overall product direction and is no longer under consideration. |
| **Needs More Information** | A feature suggestion marked **Needs More Information** means that we need more details so we can better understand your suggestion. Check the company response, where we ask for additional information to understand the request better. |
| **New** | **New** means the suggestion is newly reported by you or someone else. Action still needs to be taken. |
| **Planned** | A status of **Planned** means that your feature suggestion has a broad community impact and can improve the product experience. We have the item on our roadmap and the feedback item is updated when release information is available. |
| **Under Review** | **Under Review** indicates that the feature suggestion is in the queue for prioritization. Considering the product roadmap, we prioritize features to bring the best value to the broader community. Even if we don't implement your new feature suggestion immediately, we'll continue to monitor your idea, let the community weigh in, and then decide on the next steps. |
