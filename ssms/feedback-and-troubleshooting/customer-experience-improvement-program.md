# The Customer Experience Improvement Program

As a Visual Studio-based application, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is part of the Visual Studio Customer Experience Improvement Program (VSCEIP). The program is designed to help Microsoft improve SSMS and Visual Studio over time. This program collects information about errors, computer hardware, and how people use both applications without interrupting users in their tasks at the computer. The information collected helps Microsoft identify which features need improvement. This document covers how to opt in or out of the VSCEIP and provides information about the types of data we collect and how we use it.

## Opt out of diagnostic data collection

Given the purpose of the data we collect and the constraints on its access and retention, we recommend that you use the default privacy settings for SQL Server Management Studio and Windows. You can opt out of the program, but you're opting out of optional diagnostic data collection. Some diagnostic data collection is required to ensure SSMS is secure, up to date, and performing as expected. Required diagnostic data collection isn't affected by your choice to opt out of VSCEIP.

## Opt in or out

The VSCEIP is turned on by default. You can turn it off or back on again by following these instructions:

1. In SSMS select **Help** > **Privacy** > **Privacy Settings**.

1. The **Visual Studio Experience Improvement Program** dialog opens.

1. To opt out, select **No, I would not like to participate**, and then select OK.

1. To opt in, select **Yes, I am willing to participate (Recommended)**, and then select OK.
