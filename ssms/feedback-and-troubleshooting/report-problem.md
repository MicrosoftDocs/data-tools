# Report a problem with SQL Server Management Studio 21 Preview

You can report a problem from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) using the **Help** > **Send feedback** menu or by using the [SSMS user feedback site](https://aka.ms/ssms-feedback). When reporting an issue, it's recommended that you search the site first to see if a similar issue exists. Expand the **Groups** menu on the feedback site and select **Tooling**. Enter relevant text or keywords in the Search dialog to find existing items for the problem.

Include as much detail as possible when describing the problem, including step-by-step instructions and information such as the version of SSMS (available in **Help** > **About**), the version of SQL, and the Operating System version and language. For any error message, include the entire text and use the **Show Details** button in the error dialog to capture complete details about the error to add to the item description.

## Idea status

After you report a problem, the Stage indicates where the issue is in its lifecycle. As we review the issue and move it along the workflow, we tag it with the corresponding stage. The various stages associated with reported ideas are listed here, along with a description of their meaning.

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Archived** | A status of **Archived** means the problem is no longer applicable or insufficient information was provided to recreate the problem. |
| **Completed** | **Completed** indicates that the latest product update fixes the problem. |
| **Needs More Information** | Any problem marked **Needs More Information** means we need more details to recreate the problem internally. Check the company response, where we ask for additional information about the problem. |
| **New** | **New** means the problem is newly reported by you or someone else. Action still needs to be taken. |
| **Planned** | A status of **Planned** means that we recreated the problem, logged a tracking item internally, and planned to fix the problem in a future release. |
