# Customize (Commands page)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance Synapse Analytics PDW Fabric SE Fabric DW Fabric SQL DB](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw-fabricsqldb.md)]

This dialog box enables you to add and remove commands on toolbars and menus as well as change the images used for toolbar buttons or menu commands. You can access the **Commands** page by selecting **Customize** on the **Tools** menu and then selecting **Commands**.

## UI element list

#### Categories

Specifies the set of commands that are displayed in the **Commands** list box. The categories of commands are based on menu titles provided by the tools and designers that the environment is currently supporting. This list of titles is dynamic so that the order of categories and the menu titles change, depending on the tools and the designer, as well as any customizations made to them. Therefore, it's possible for two menus from different designers to have the same name, so the same title can appear twice but offer different command sets.

#### Commands

Displays the commands and command images based on the category you selected. You can drag a command onto the toolbar you want to customize.

#### Modify Selection

Displays a list of commands you can use to customize the display of the button on the toolbar. For example, you can change the image or accelerator keys, and specify whether to display text instead of an image for the command. This button is available after you select a command button on a toolbar you want to customize.

#### Rearrange Commands

Displays the **Rearrange Commands** dialog box, which allows you to rename, reorder, add, and remove commands on menus and toolbars as well as change button and command images.

#### Keyboard

Displays the **Keyboard** page of the **Options** dialog box so you can specify shortcut key combinations for commands.
