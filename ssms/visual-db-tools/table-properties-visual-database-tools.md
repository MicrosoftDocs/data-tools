# Table properties (Visual Database Tools)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

These properties appear in the Properties window when you right-click in Table Designer and select Properties. Unless otherwise noted, you can edit these properties in the Properties window when the table is selected.

> [!NOTE]  
> If the table is published for replication, you must make schema changes using the Transact-SQL statement [ALTER TABLE](/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql) or SQL Server Management Objects (SMO). When schema changes are made using the Table Designer or the Database Diagram Designer, it attempts to drop and recreate the table. You can't drop published objects, therefore the schema change fails.

## Show table properties in Table Designer

> [!NOTE]  
> The properties in this article are ordered by category rather than alphabet.

#### Identity Category

Expands to show properties for **Name**, **Description**, and **Schema**.

#### Name

Displays the name of the table. To edit the name, type in the text box.

> [!CAUTION]  
> If existing queries, views, user-defined functions, stored procedures, or programs refer to the table, the name modification makes these objects invalid.

#### Database Name

Shows the name of the data source of the selected table.

#### Description

Shows a description of the selected table. To see the entire description, or to edit it, select the description and then select the ellipses **(...)** to the right of the property.

#### Schema

Shows the name of the schema to which this table belongs. (Applies only to Microsoft SQL Server.)

#### Server Name

Shows the name of the server for the data source.

#### Table Designer Category

Expands to show properties for **Identity Column**, **Is Indexable**, and **Is Replicated**.

#### Identity Column

Shows the column used as the table's identity column. To change the identity column, choose from the dropdown list. Only columns of a numeric data type show in the list.

#### Is Indexable

Shows whether the table can be indexed. If the table isn't indexable it might be because you aren't the table owner or because the table contains columns with data types of text, ntext, or image.

#### Is Replicated

Shows whether the table is replicated in another location.

#### Regular Data Space Specification Category

Expands to show properties for **(Data Space Type)**, **Filegroup or Partition Scheme Name**, and **Partition Column List**.

#### (Data Space Type)

Shows whether this table is stored using a filegroup or partition scheme.

#### Filegroup or Partition Scheme Name

Shows the name of the filegroup or partition scheme.

#### Partition Column List

Provides access to the **Partition Column List** dialog box.

#### Row GUID Column

Shows the column used by Microsoft SQL Server as the table's ROWGUID column. To change the ROWGUID column, choose from the dropdown list. (Applies only to SQL Server 7.0 or higher.)

#### Text/Image Filegroup

Provides a dropdown list from which you can choose the filegroup for columns that have text or image data types. If the table is stored using a partition scheme, leave this field blank.
