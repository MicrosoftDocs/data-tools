# Verify queries (Visual Database Tools)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

To avoid problems, you can check the query you have built to ensure its syntax is correct. This option is especially useful when you enter statements in the [SQL Pane (Visual Database Tools)](sql-pane-visual-database-tools.md).

When you verify queries, keep in mind:

- A statement can be valid, and therefore be verified successfully, even if it can't be represented in the **Diagram Pane** and **Criteria Pane**.

- SQL Verification can detect some, but not all SQL errors. If a query contains an error not detected during SQL verification, the database detects the error when you run the query.

- Queries that contain parameters can't be verified.

## Verify a SQL statement

Right-click in the **SQL Pane**, and select **Verify SQL Syntax** from the shortcut menu.
