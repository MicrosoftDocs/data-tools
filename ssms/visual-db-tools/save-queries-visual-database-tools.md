# Save Queries (Visual Database Tools)
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
Save your query when you want to work with it later. Note that running your query does not save your changes.  
  
### To save a query  
  
1.  Create your query.  
  
2.  From the **File** menu, click **Save <query_name>**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > A newly created query will be given a system name. To choose your own name for the query choose **Save<query_name> As**.  
  
3.  The query will be saved in the Query folder of the project in Solution Explorer.
