# Save queries (Visual Database Tools)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Save your query when you want to work with it later. Running your query doesn't save your changes.

## Save a query

1. Create your query.

1. From the **File** menu, select **Save <query_name>**.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > A newly created query is given a system name. To choose your own name for the query choose **Save<query_name> As**.

1. The query is saved in the Query folder of the project in Solution Explorer.
