# Open Database Diagram Designer (Visual Database Tools)

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-pdw.md)]

The Database Diagram Designer is a visual tool that allows you to design and visualize a database to which you are connected. When designing a database, you can use Database Designer to create, edit, or delete tables, columns, keys, indexes, relationships, and constraints. To visualize a database, you can create one or more diagrams illustrating some or all of the tables, columns, keys, and relationships in it.  
  
You can open Database Diagram Designer by opening a new or existing diagram.  
  
### Open a new database diagram  
  
1.  Right-click the Database Diagrams node of your database in Object Explorer.  
  
2.  From the drop-down menu, click **New Database Diagram**.  
  
3.  In the **Add Table** dialog box, choose tables to work with in the diagram.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you choose **Close** without adding tables, you can go back and add tables later.  
  
4.  The **Database Diagram** menu will be added to the main menu and the designer pane will open.  
  
### Open an existing database diagram  
  
1.  Right-click the diagram under the Database Diagrams node of your database in Object Explorer.  
  
2.  From the drop-down menu, click **Design Database Diagram**.  
  
3.  The **Database Diagram** menu will be added to the main menu and the diagram will open in the designer pane.
