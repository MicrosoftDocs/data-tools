# Open Database Diagram Designer (Visual Database Tools)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-pdw.md)]

The Database Diagram Designer is a visual tool that allows you to design and visualize a database to which you're connected. When designing a database, you can use Database Designer to create, edit, or delete tables, columns, keys, indexes, relationships, and constraints. To visualize a database, you can create one or more diagrams illustrating some or all of the tables, columns, keys, and relationships in it.

You can open Database Diagram Designer by opening a new or existing diagram.

## Open a new database diagram

1. Right-click the Database Diagrams node of your database in Object Explorer.

1. From the dropdown list menu, select **New Database Diagram**.

1. In the **Add Table** dialog box, choose tables to work with in the diagram.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If you choose **Close** without adding tables, you can go back and add tables later.

1. The **Database Diagram** menu is added to the main menu, and the designer pane opens.

## Open an existing database diagram

1. Right-click the diagram under the Database Diagrams node of your database in Object Explorer.

1. From the dropdown list menu, select **Design Database Diagram**.

1. The **Database Diagram** menu is added to the main menu, and the diagram opens in the designer pane.
