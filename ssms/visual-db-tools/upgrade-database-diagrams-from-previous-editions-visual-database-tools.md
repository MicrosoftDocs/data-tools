# Upgrade Database Diagrams from Previous Editions (Visual Database Tools)
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
Database diagrams created on previous editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] databases are upgraded automatically when database diagramming is set up on [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more steps for setting up diagramming see [Set Up Database Diagram Designer](set-up-database-diagram-designer-visual-database-tools.md).  
  
### To upgrade legacy database diagrams  
  
1.  From Object Explorer, expand the database.  
  
2.  Expand the Database Diagram node under the database.  
  
3.  Select **Yes** when prompted if you want to set up database diagramming.  
  
    This will upgrade diagrams stored on the database.
