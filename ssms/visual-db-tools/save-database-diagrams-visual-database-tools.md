# Save database diagrams (Visual Database Tools)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

By saving a database diagram, you can save all the changes you made to it, including any changes you made to the tables, columns, and other database objects.

## Save the database diagram

1. From the **File** menu, choose **Save \<**_tablename_**>**.

1. If this is a new diagram that you have never before saved, the **Save As** dialog box appears. Type a name for the diagram.

   If you made changes to tables in an existing diagram, the **Save** dialog box appears and displays a list of changes that are saved in the database when you save your diagram.

1. Select **Yes** (or **OK** if this is a new diagram) to update the database to match your diagram.
