# Open queries (Visual Database Tools)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

You can open an existing query in Query and View Designer by using the **Open** command.

## Open a query in all panes

1. From the **View** menu, select **Solution Explorer**.

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the query you want to open and select **Open**.

1. To modify the query in Query Designer, highlight the SQL statements, right-click the highlighted area and select **Design Query in Editor.**

> [!NOTE]  
> By default the Query and View Designer opens all of its panes (SQL, Criteria, Diagram, and Results), but that default can be changed in the **Options** dialog box. To open these panes if they are closed, from the **Query Designer** menu, point to **Pane**, and then select the pane you want to open.
