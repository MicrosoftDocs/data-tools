# Display Query and View Designer panes (Visual Database Tools)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

The Query and View Designer is composed of four separate panes: the Diagram pane, the Criteria pane, the SQL pane, and the Results pane. Typically when you open a view or create a new query all four windows open, but if you need to open any of these windows, you can do so as long as the Query and View Designer is open.

## Display Query and View Designer panes

1. Open a view or create a new query to open the Query and View Designer.

1. From the **Query Designer** menu, point to **Pane** and select the name of the pane you want to open.
