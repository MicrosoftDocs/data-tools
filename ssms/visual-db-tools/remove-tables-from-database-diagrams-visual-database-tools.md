# Remove tables from database diagrams (Visual Database Tools)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-pdw.md)]

You can remove a table from your database diagram. Removing a table doesn't alter your database. The table and its relationships to other tables continue to exist in the database.

## Remove a table from a database diagram

1. In your database diagram, select the table you want to remove.

1. Right-click the table and choose **Remove Table from Diagram** from the shortcut menu.

   -or-

   Press the ESC key.

   If the table has unsaved changes as a result of edits you made in the database diagram, a message prompts you to save the table before removing it.

The table is removed from your diagram but it continues to exist in the database.
