# Remove Tables from Database Diagrams (Visual Database Tools)

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-pdw.md)]

You can remove a table from your database diagram. Removing a table does not alter your database. The table and its relationships to other tables continue to exist in the database.  
  
### To remove a table from a database diagram  
  
1.  In your database diagram, select the table you want to remove.  
  
2.  Right-click the table and choose **Remove Table from Diagram** from the shortcut menu.  
  
    -or-  
  
    Press the ESC key.  
  
    If the table has unsaved changes as a result of edits you made in the database diagram, a message prompts you to save the table before removing it.  
  
The table is removed from your diagram but it continues to exist in the database.
