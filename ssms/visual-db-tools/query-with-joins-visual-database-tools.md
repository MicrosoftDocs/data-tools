# Query with joins (Visual Database Tools)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

A query result can include data from multiple tables or table-valued objects. To combine data from multiple table-valued objects, you use the `JOIN` operation from SQL.

For information about creating queries using multiple tables, see the following topics.
