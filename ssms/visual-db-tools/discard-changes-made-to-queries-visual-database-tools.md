# Discard changes made to queries (Visual Database Tools)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

You can discard changes made to a query definition prior to saving them. Once they have been saved, they can't be returned to a previous state.

> [!NOTE]  
> To undo a change you've made to values in the Results pane, press the ESC key before you move off of the record. If you move off of a record and receive a notice that the changes aren't committed to the database, you can also press the ESC key to revert to the previous value.

## Discard changes made to a query definition

1. With the query open in Query and View Designer, from the **File** menu, select **Close**.

1. In the **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** dialog box, select **No**.

   The query definition returns to the state it was in at the last save.
