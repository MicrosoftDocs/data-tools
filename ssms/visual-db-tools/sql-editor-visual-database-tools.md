# SQL Editor (Visual Database Tools)

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
Use the SQL Editor to edit existing stored procedures, functions, triggers, and SQL scripts. This window opens when you open any of those objects. If you want to create a new SQL statement to run against your data source, use the [SQL Pane](sql-pane-visual-database-tools.md) of Query Designer.  
  
The SQL editor provides many useful SQL text-editing features, including:  
  
-   Color coding of SQL keywords to minimize syntax and spelling errors.  
  
-   Generating skeletal stored procedures and triggers.  
  
-   Providing useful editing functions, including cut, copy, paste, and dragging operations.  
  
-   Changing the editor's behavior (by selecting **Options** from the **Tools** menu) to modify virtual spaces, word wrap, line numbers, and tab size.  
  
-   Helping manage debugging breakpoints.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The SQL Editor does not have IntelliSense prompting.  
  
When editing SQL statements, certain Transact-SQL statements are enclosed in a box surrounded by a thin line. This helps to visually break the SQL code into command sections, and identifies blocks of SQL statements that can be graphically designed using Query Designer. For more information on using Query Designer, see [Design Queries and Views How-to Topics &#40;Visual Database Tools&#41;](design-queries-and-views-how-to-topics-visual-database-tools.md).
