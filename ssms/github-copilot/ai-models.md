With [!INCLUDE [ssms-22-md](../includes/ssms-22-md.md)], GitHub Copilot in SSMS selects a default model to provide fast response times, high-quality suggestions, and improve efficiency for coding tasks. The default model varies based on your subscription.

However, you're not limited to using this model. You can also select a different model that best fits your requirements.

## Available models

Choose from a curated set of models in the model picker, such as:

- GPT-5
- GPT-5 mini
- GPT-4.1
- GPT-4o
- Claude Sonnet 3.5
- Claude Sonnet 4
- Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Claude Haiku 4.5
- Gemini 2.5 Pro

Model availability depends on your Copilot subscription and the current status of each model. For Copilot Enterprise and Business, administrators must enable the Preview policy in Copilot settings before models are available in SSMS.
