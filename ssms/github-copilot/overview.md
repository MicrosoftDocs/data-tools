# What is GitHub Copilot in SQL Server Management Studio (Preview)?

GitHub Copilot in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) helps you write Transact-SQL (T-SQL) faster and with greater accuracy. It can also answer general SQL questions and assist with administrator tasks, directly in your SSMS environment.

GitHub Copilot in SSMS doesn't retain any of your information (prompts, responses, system metadata, etc.) and doesn't use any of your data to train or retrain models. For more information, see [How GitHub Copilot handles data](https://resources.github.com/learn/pathways/copilot/essentials/how-github-copilot-handles-data/).

GitHub Copilot in SSMS can answer questions for databases in SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and SQL Database in Fabric. GitHub Copilot executes queries based on the permissions for your login. For example, if you don't have permission to select from the table `Sales.Orders` and you ask GitHub Copilot to write and execute a select query such as `SELECT TOP 100 * FROM Sales.Orders`, the query execution can't occur.

## How GitHub Copilot works in SSMS

GitHub Copilot in SSMS uses your GitHub account with [Copilot access](https://docs.github.com/copilot/get-started/what-is-github-copilot#getting-access-to-copilot). The integration currently uses GPT-4.1, and GitHub Copilot in SSMS sends your prompts to the model. The model generates the response and sends it back to SSMS. GitHub Copilot in SSMS might send additional information about the version of SQL to which you're connected, or information about your database, along with your prompt to help improve the response.

## Features of GitHub Copilot in SSMS

GitHub Copilot in SSMS includes [chat capabilities](chat.md) in the chat window and through the inline chat view. From either location you can use natural language to ask questions about your database, or get help writing T-SQL. Copilot in SSMS also includes code assistance, available using [slash commands](chat-context.md#use-slash-commands-for-code-assistance) such as `/doc`, to provide assistance documenting, explaining, fixing, or optimizing your T-SQL queries. To enable GitHub Copilot in SSMS, see [Install GitHub Copilot in SQL Server Management Studio (Preview)](installation-state.md).

## Best practices for using GitHub Copilot in SSMS

To maximize your productivity with GitHub Copilot in SSMS, open a query editor that is connected to your database, and then open the chat window. By default, the chat window has context about the database to which you're connected based on the active query editor. When writing prompts, be specific in your request as vague questions lead to vague responses. For more best practices, see [Best practices for GitHub Copilot in SQL Server Management Studio (Preview)](best-practices.md).

## Example prompts

The following example prompts are clear, specific, and tailored to the properties of your schema and database, making it easier for GitHub Copilot in SSMS to generate accurate replies.

  ```copilot-prompt
    - What are the top-selling products by quantity?
    - How do I change the compability mode for this database?
    - Is there blocking in my database right now?
  ```
