# Manage Bookmarks

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

While you are working in a code editor, the **Bookmarks** window allows you to create links to specific lines of code within your document. You can display this window from the **View** menu.  
  
 To create and navigate through bookmarks, click the buttons located on the **TextEditor** toolbar and at the top of the **Bookmarks** window. You can add and remove bookmarks, activate or disable bookmarks, and organize bookmarks into folders. Certain commands are also available from the **Bookmarks** window shortcut menu. To add or remove a bookmark, place the insertion point on the desired line in the Editor, and then click **Toggle a bookmark**. To activate a bookmark, select its check box in the **Bookmarks** window; to disable (but not remove) a bookmark, clear its check box.  
  
## Text Editor Toolbar  
 The following buttons are enabled on the **Text Editor** toolbar when a text document is opened in the Editor. To display the **Text Editor** toolbar when you are in the Query Editor, on the **View** menu, point to **Toolbars**, and then click **Text Editor**.  
  
 **Toggle a bookmark on the current line**  
 Adds or removes a bookmark on the selected line of the document in the active Editor. Does not alter the line of code bookmarked.  
  
 **Move the caret to previous bookmark**  
 Selects the previous bookmark that is enabled in the **Bookmarks** window. When the first bookmark is reached, jumps ahead to the last one. As needed, opens the file where the selected bookmark occurs in the Editor. Scrolls that document to the bookmarked line, and places the insertion point there.  
  
 **Move the caret to the next bookmark**  
 Selects the next bookmark that is enabled in the **Bookmarks** window. When the last bookmark is reached, jumps back to the first one. As needed, opens the file where the selected bookmark occurs in the Editor. Scrolls that document to the bookmarked line, and places the insertion point there.  
  
 **Clear all bookmarks in the current document**  
 Displays a confirmation message, and then removes all bookmarks from the active document. Does not remove the lines of code that were bookmarked.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
>  You cannot undo this procedure. Afterward, you must use **Toggle a bookmark on the current line** to create new bookmarks. To disable bookmarks but not remove them, clear their check boxes in the **Bookmarks** window.  
  
## Bookmarks Window

 **Move the caret to previous bookmark in the current folder**
