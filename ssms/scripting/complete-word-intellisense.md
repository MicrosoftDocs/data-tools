# Complete Word (IntelliSense)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] IntelliSense Complete Word option types the rest of a variable, command, or function name once you have entered enough characters to uniquely identify the term.  
  
There are four ways to invoke the Complete Word feature:  
  
- On the **Edit** menu, point to **IntelliSense**, and then select **Complete Word**.  
  
- Press ALT+RIGHT ARROW.  
  
- Right-click the text editor, and select **Complete Word**.  
  
- Select the **Complete Word** button on the **Text Editor** toolbar.  
  
If what you have typed has more than one possible match, invoke Complete Word to display a list of possible matches, which you can then use to find the term and insert it into your code.
