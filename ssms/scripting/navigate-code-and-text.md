# Navigate code and text

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

You can move through text by using:

- Bookmarks
- Incremental search
- Mouse and navigation keys
- The **Go To** command

> [!NOTE]  
> For a complete list of keyboard shortcut keys, see [SQL Server Management Studio keyboard shortcuts](../sql-server-management-studio-keyboard-shortcuts.md).

## Navigate with bookmarks

To edit a document elsewhere and then return to your original location, add a bookmark. You set bookmarks and move to them using keyboard shortcuts. View the bookmarks in the bookmark window.

## Incremental search

Incremental search helps you navigate directly to locations in the current document as you enter the search characters. You can access incremental search with keyboard shortcuts.

## Navigate with the mouse and keyboard

The most common way to navigate text is with the mouse and navigation keys:

- Use the **Left Arrow** and **Right Arrow** keys to move one character at a time or in combination with the **Ctrl** key to move one word at a time. The **Up Arrow** and **Down Arrow** keys move one line at a time.

- Select a location to place the cursor there.

- Use the scroll bars or scroll wheel on the mouse to move through the text.

- Use the **Home**, **End**, **Page Up**, and **Page Down** keys to move through the text.

- Use **Ctrl**+**Page Up** and **Ctrl**+**Page Down** to move the insertion point to the top or bottom of the window, respectively.

- Use **Ctrl**+**Up Arrow** and **Ctrl**+**Down Arrow** to scroll the view without moving the insertion point.

## GoTo command

Use the **GoTo** command to go to a specific line number. To make line numbering visible, in the **Options** dialog box, select **Text Editor**, select **All Languages**, select **General**, and then select **Line numbers**.

### Go to a specific line number

1. Select **Go To** on the **Edit** menu

1. Enter the line number you want to view
