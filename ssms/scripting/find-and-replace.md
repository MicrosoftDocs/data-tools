# Find and Replace
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]
  Use the **Find and Replace** dialog box to locate text within a file and optionally replace it. Versions of the **Find and Replace** dialog box with slightly different options can appear, depending on how the dialog box was opened. On the **Edit** menu, point to **Find and Replace**, and then click **Quick Find** to open the dialog box with find options, but without replace options. On the **Edit** menu, point to **Find and Replace**, and then click **Quick Replace** to open the dialog box with both find options and replace options.  
  
 Toolbar buttons and shortcut keys are also available to open the **Find and Replace** dialog box.  
  
## Find What  
 These controls enable you to specify the string or expression that will be matched.  
  
 **Find what**  
 Type the text to search for. The dialog box attempts to fill in a probable search text, using text selected with the cursor before opening the dialog box, or nearby text, or previously searched-for text. You can reuse one of the last 20 search strings by selecting it from this drop-down list.  
  
 **[string with wildcards]**  
 If you want to use wildcards such as asterisks (`*`) and question marks (`?`) in your search string, select the **Use** check box under **Find Options** and then click **Wildcards**.  
  
 **[regular expression]**  
 To cause the search engine to interpret your search string as a regular expression, select the **Use** check box under **Find Options** and then click **Regular expressions**.  
  
 **Expression Builder**  
 This triangular button next to the **Find what** box becomes available when the **Use** check box is selected in **Find Options**. Click this button to display a list of wildcards or regular expressions, depending upon the **Use** option selected. Choosing any item from this list adds it to the string specified in the **Find what** box.  
  
## Replace With  
 These controls enable you to specify what will be inserted in the place of the matched string or expression.  
  
 **Replace with**  
 To replace instances of the string specified in **Find what** with another string, enter the replacement string in this field. To delete instances of the text specified in **Find what**, leave this field blank. Select the drop-down list to display the last 20 items entered. To include regular expressions in the string specified in the **Replace with** box, click the **Use** check box and then click **Regular Expressions**. This box only appears if this dialog box was opened by clicked **Quick Replace**.  
  
 **Replace with**  
 To replace instances of the string specified in the **Find what** box with another string, enter the replacement string in this field. To delete instances of the string specified in the **Find what** box, leave this field blank. Select the drop-down list to display the last 20 items entered. To include regular expressions in the string specified in the **Replace with** box, click the **Use** check box and then click **Regular Expressions**.  
  
 **Expression Builder**  
 This triangular button next to the **Replace with** box becomes available when the **Use** check box is selected in **Find Options**. Click this button to display a list of wildcards or regular expressions, depending upon the **Use** option selected. Clicking any item in this list adds it to the string specified in the **Replace with** box.  
  
 **Replace**  
 Click this button to replace the current instance of the string specified in the **Find what** box with the string specified in the **Replace with** box, and find the next instance within the scope specified in **Look in**.  
  
 **Replace all**  
 Click this button to replace all instances of the string specified in the **Find what** box with the string specified in the **Replace with** box, in all files within the scope specified in the **Look in** box.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
>  Make sure that **Look in** is set to include only those files that you want to modify.  
  
 A reminder is displayed that includes a **Keep modified files open** option. To retain the **Undo** option, you must select this option. **Undo** is only available in files that remain open for editing after they are modified.  
  
 **Skip File**  
 Becomes available when the value specified for **Look in** includes multiple files. Click this button if you do not want to search or modify the current file. The search will continue in the next file on the list in **Look in**.  
  
## Look In  
 **Look in**  
 Select the location to look for the text specified in **Find what**. Options are **Current Document**, which searches the document window that had focus when the dialog box was opened, and **All Open Documents**, which searches all document windows that are currently open in SQL Server Management Studio.  
  
## Find Options  
 You can expand or collapse the **Find Options** section. The following options can be selected or cleared.  
  
 **Match case**  
 When this check box is selected, the Find Results windows will only display instances of the string specified in **Find what** that are matched both by content and by case. For example, a search for "**MyObject**" with the **Match case** check box selected will return "MyObject" but not "myobject" or "MYOBJECT."  
  
 **Match whole word**  
 When selected, the Find Results windows will only display instances of the string specified in **Find what** that are matched in complete words. For example, a search for **MyObject** will return "MyObject" but not "CMyObject" or "MyObjectC."  
  
 **Search up**  
 Search from the cursor location towards the beginning of the document.  
  
 **Search hidden text**  
 Locate instances of the text that are concealed and collapsed text.  
  
 **Use**  
 Indicates how to interpret special characters entered in the **Find what** or **Replace with** text boxes. The options include **Wildcards** and **Regular Expressions**.  
  
 **Regular Expressions**  
 Special notations define patterns of text to match. For a list, see [Search Text with Regular Expressions](search-text-with-regular-expressions.md).  
  
 **Wildcards**  
 Special characters such as asterisks (`*`) and question marks (`?`) represent one or more characters. For a list, see [Search text with regular expressions](search-text-with-regular-expressions.md).  
  
 **Find Next**  
 Begins searching for the text in the **Find what** box.  
  
 **Replace**  
 Click this button to replace the current instance of the string specified in **Find what** with the string specified in **Replace with**, and find the next instance within the scope specified in **Look in**.  
  
 **Replace All**  
 Choose this button to replace all instances of the string specified in **Find what** with the string specified in **Replace with**, in all files within the scope specified in **Look in**.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
>  Make sure that **Look in** is set to include only those files that you want to modify.
