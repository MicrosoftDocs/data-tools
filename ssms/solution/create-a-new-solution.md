# Create a new solution

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

When you create a project, [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] (SSMS) creates a solution to contain it. You can only open one solution at a time.

SSMS doesn't allow you to create folders within projects. You can organize your work by creating multiple projects.

To access Solution Explorer, select **Solution Explorer** on the **View** menu.
