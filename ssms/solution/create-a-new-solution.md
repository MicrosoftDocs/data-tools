# Create a New Solution
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]
When you create a project, [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] creates a solution to contain it. You can only open one solution at a time. [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] does not allow you to create folders within projects. To organize your work, create multiple projects.  
  
To access Solution Explorer, click **Solution Explorer** on the **View** menu.  
  
### To create a new solution and project  
  
1.  On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**.
