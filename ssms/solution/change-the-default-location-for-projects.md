# Change the default location for projects

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

The default location for files and projects is the [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] Projects folder in your `My Documents` folder.

## Change the default location

1. Change the default location by opening or saving a file or project from another location. SQL Server Management Studio stores the location of the previously opened project and uses it for the next opening or saving of a project.
