# Remove a server group in SQL Server Management Studio

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

This article describes how to remove a server group in Registered Servers in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). You can delete a server group at any time. If the server group isn't empty, any servers or server groups contained in the deleted server group are also deleted.

Before deleting a server group, move any servers or server groups that you want to retain to a new server group.

If the Registered Servers tool window isn't visible in SSMS, select **View** > **Registered Servers**, or type **Ctrl** + **Alt** + **G**.

## Remove a server group

1. In the Registered Servers pane, find the server group you want to remove, right-click, and select **Delete**.
1. In the **Delete Confirmation** dialog box, select **Yes**.
