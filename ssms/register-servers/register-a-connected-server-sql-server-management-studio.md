# Register a Connected Server (SQL Server Management Studio)

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

This topic describes how to register a connected server in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). By registering the server, you can save the connection information for servers that you access frequently. A server can be registered before connecting, or at the time of connection from Object Explorer.  You can view your registered servers in SSMS by navigating to **View**\\**Registered Servers** from the menu.

-   **To register a server, using:**  
  
     [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMSProcedure)  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To register a connected server  
  
In Object Explorer, right-click a server to which you already are connected, and then click **Register**.
  
**Server name**  
This field defaults to the server name you connected to.  Optionally, you can type a server name or choose one from the drop-down list.

**Authentication**  
Two authentication modes are available when connecting to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. 

-    **Windows Authentication**  
Windows Authentication mode allows a user to connect through a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows user account. 

-    **SQL Server Authentication**   
When a user connects with a specified login name and password from a nontrusted connection, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] performs the authentication itself by checking whether a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login account has been set up and whether the specified password matches the one previously recorded. If [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] does not have a login account set, authentication fails, and the user receives an error message.

     > [!IMPORTANT]  
     > [!INCLUDE[ssNoteWinAuthentication](../includes/ssnotewinauthentication-md.md)] For more information, see [Choose an Authentication Mode](/sql/relational-databases/security/choose-an-authentication-mode).  

     -    **User name**  
Shows the current user name you are connecting with. This read-only option is only available if you have selected to connect using Windows Authentication. To change **User names**, log in to the computer as a different user. 

     -    **Login**  
Enter the login to connect with. This option is available only if you have selected to connect using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication.  

     -    **Password**  
Enter the password for the login. This option can be edited only if you have selected to connect by using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication. 

     -    **Remember password**  
Select to have [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] encrypt and store the password you have entered. This option is displayed only if you have selected to connect using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication.  

          > [!NOTE]  
          > If you have stored the password and want to stop storing it, clear this check box, and then click **Save**.  

**Registered server name**  
The name you want to appear in Registered Servers. This name does not have to match the **Server name** box.  
  
**Registered server description**  
Enter an optional description of the server.  
  
**Test**  
Click to test the connection to the server selected in **Server name**.  
  
**Save**  
Click to save the registered server settings.
