# Disconnect from a registered server in SQL Server Management Studio

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

This article describes how to disconnect from a server at any time in Object Explorer. Disconnecting in Object Explorer doesn't disconnect other SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) components such as the Query Editor.

## Disconnect from a registered server

In Object Explorer, right-click a server and select **Disconnect** or, on the Object Explorer toolbar, select the **Disconnect** icon.
