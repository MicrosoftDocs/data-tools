# Register Servers

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

Registering a server in SQL Server Management Studio allows you to store the server connection information for future connections.There are three ways to register a server in SQL Server Management Studio.  
  
1.  Local instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are automatically registered during the first launch of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] after its installation.  
  
2.  You can also initiate the automatic registration process at any time, to restore the registration of local server instances.  
  
3.  Lastly, you can register a server using the Registered Servers tool in SQL Server Management Studio.  
  
## Benefits of Registered Servers  
 With Registered Servers you can:  
  
-   Register servers to preserve the connection information.  
  
-   Determine if a registered server is running.  
  
-   Easily connect Object Explorer and Query Editor to a registered server.  
  
-   Edit or delete the registration information for a registered server.  
  
-   Create groups of servers.  
  
-   Provide user-friendly names for registered servers by providing a value in the **Registered server name** box that is different from the **Server name** list.  
  
-   Provide detailed descriptions for registered servers.  
  
-   Provide detailed descriptions of registered server groups.  
  
-   Export registered server groups.  
  
-   Import registered server groups.  
  
-   View the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] log files for online or offline instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
