# Object Explorer

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

[!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] provides features for managing objects in instances of the [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)], [!INCLUDE [ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE [ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE [ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].

## Benefits of Object Explorer

Object Explorer provides a hierarchical user interface to view and manage the objects in each instance of SQL Server. The Object Explorer Details pane presents a tabular view of instance objects, and the capability to search for specific objects. The capabilities of Object Explorer vary slightly depending on the type of server, but generally include the development features for databases, and management features for all server types.
