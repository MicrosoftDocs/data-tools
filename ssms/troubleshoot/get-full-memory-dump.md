1. Unzip the download into a folder.
1. Open a Command Prompt (such as `cmd.exe`), and run the following command.

    ```console
    <PathToProcDumpFolder>\procdump.exe -e -h -ma -w ssms.exe
    ```

    It should prompt you to accept a license agreement, select **Agree**.

1. Start SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) if not started already.
1. Reproduce your issue.
1. Wait as the text appears in the cmd prompt about writing the dump file, don't proceed until it finishes.

    * "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\SOS.dll"
