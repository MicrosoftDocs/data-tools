# Use the Toolbox

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

You can select and drag items, text, and controls from the Toolbox on to forms, pages, and designers, and drag items from these sources back into the Toolbox for reuse later. For example, in SQL Server Management Studio you can drag a task onto a Maintenance Plan.

Items in the Toolbox are grouped into sections called tabs. Here's a reference list of common Toolbox tasks and how to do them:

| To | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| Open the Toolbox | On the **View** menu, select **Toolbox**. |
| Make the Toolbox close automatically | Open the Toolbox. On the **Window** menu, select **Auto Hide**. |
| Make the Toolbox stay open | Open the Toolbox. On the **Window** menu, clear **Auto Hide**. |
| Move the Toolbox to a different location | Open the Toolbox. On the **Window** menu, clear **Auto Hide**, and then select **Floating**. Drag the Toolbox to the desired location. |
| Hide the Toolbox | In the **Window** menu, select **Hide**. (To reopen the Toolbox, select **Toolbox** on the **View** menu.) |

| Expand Toolbox tabs one after another | Press **Ctrl**+**Down Arrow** to expand the next Toolbox tab, or **Ctrl**+**Up Arrow** to expand the previous tab. |
