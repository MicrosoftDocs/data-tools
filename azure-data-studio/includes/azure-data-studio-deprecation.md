> Azure Data Studio is [retiring on February 28, 2026](/lifecycle/definitions#retirement). We recommend that you use the [MSSQL extension for Visual Studio Code](/sql/tools/visual-studio-code-extensions/mssql/mssql-extension-visual-studio-code). For more information about migrating to Visual Studio Code, visit [What's happening to Azure Data Studio?](../whats-happening-azure-data-studio.md)
