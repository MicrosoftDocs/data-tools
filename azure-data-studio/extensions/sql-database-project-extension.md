# SQL Database Projects extension

The SQL Database Projects extension is an Azure Data Studio and Visual Studio Code extension for developing SQL databases in a project-based development environment. Compatible databases include SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse SQL.  A SQL project is a local representation of SQL objects that comprise the schema for a single database, such as tables, stored procedures, or functions. When a SQL Database project is built, the output artifact is a *.dacpac* file. New and existing databases can be updated to match the contents of the *.dacpac* by publishing the SQL Database project with the SQL Database Projects extension or by publishing the *.dacpac* with the command line interface [SqlPackage](/sql/tools/sqlpackage/sqlpackage-publish).

## Extension features

The SQL Database Projects extension provides the following features: 

- Create a new blank project.
- Create a new project from a connected database.
- Open a project previously created in [Azure Data Studio, Visual Studio Code](sql-database-project-extension-getting-started.md) or in [SQL Server Data Tools](/sql/ssdt/sql-server-data-tools).
- Edit a project by adding or removing objects (tables, views, stored procedures) or custom scripts in the project.
- Organize files/scripts in folders.
- Add references to system databases or a user dacpac.
- Build a single project.
- Deploy a single project.
- Load connection details (SQL Windows authentication) and SQLCMD variables from deployment profile.

The following features in the SQL Database Projects extension are currently in preview:

- Create new projects from an [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) specification file.
- SDK-style SQL projects ([Microsoft.Build.Sql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.Sql/)).

## Install

You can install the SQL Database Project extension in Azure Data Studio and Visual Studio Code. 

### Azure Data Studio

To install the SQL Database Project extension in Azure Data Studio, follow these steps: 

1. Open the extensions manager to access the available extensions.  To do so, either select the extensions icon or select **Extensions** in the **View** menu.
1. Identify the *SQL Database Projects* extension by typing all or part of the name in the extension search box. Select an available extension to view its details.

1. Select the extension you want and choose to **Install** it.
1. Select **Reload** to enable the extension (only required the first time you install an extension).
1. Select the **Projects** icon from the activity bar.


> [!NOTE]
> - It is recommended to install the [Schema Compare extension](schema-compare-extension.md) alongside the SQL Database Projects extension for full functionality.



### Visual Studio Code

The SQL Database Projects extension is installed with the [mssql](/sql/tools/visual-studio-code/sql-server-develop-use-vscode) extension for Visual Studio Code.

## Dependencies

The SQL Database Projects extension has a dependency on the .NET SDK (required) and AutoRest.Sql (optional).

### .NET SDK

The .NET SDK is required for project build functionality and you are prompted to install the .NET SDK if a supported version can't be detected by the extension.  The .NET SDK can be downloaded and installed for [Windows, macOS, and Linux](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0). 

If you would like to [check currently installed versions](/dotnet/core/install/how-to-detect-installed-versions) of the dotnet SDK, open a terminal and run the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet --list-sdks
```

After installing the .NET SDK, your environment is ready to use the SQL Database Projects extension.

#### Common issues

**Nuget.org missing from the list of sources may result in error messages such as:**
- `error MSB4236: The SDK 'Microsoft.Build.Sql/0.1.9-preview' specified could not be found.`
- `Unable to find package Microsoft.Build.Sql. No packages exist with this id in source(s): Microsoft Visual Studio Offline Packages`

To check if nuget.org is registered as a source, run `dotnet nuget list source` from the command line and review the results for an `[Enabled]` item referencing nuget.org. If nuget.org is not registered as a source, run `dotnet nuget add source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json -n nuget.org`.

**Unsupported .NET SDK versions may result in error messages such as:**
- `error MSB4018: The "SqlBuildTask" task failed unexpectedly.`
- `error MSB4018: System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for 'SqlSchemaModelStaticState' threw an exception. ---> System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Runtime, Version=4.2.2.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'. The system cannot find the file specified. [c:\Users\ .sqlproj]_` (where the linked non-existing file has an unmatched closing square bracket). 

To force the SQL Database Projects extension to use the v6.x version of the .NET SDK when multiple versions are installed, add a [global.json](/dotnet/core/tools/global-json) file to the folder that contains the SQL project. 


### AutoRest.Sql

The SQL extension for [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) is automatically downloaded and used by the SQL Database Projects extension when a SQL project is generated from an OpenAPI specification file.


## Limitations

Currently, the SQL Database Project extension has the following limitations: 

- Tasks (build/publish) aren't user-defined.
- SQLCLR objects in projects aren't supported.
- Code analysis rules on projects aren't supported at this time.

## Workspace

SQL database projects are contained within a logical workspace in Azure Data Studio and Visual Studio Code. A workspace manages the folder(s) visible in the Explorer pane. **All SQL projects within the folders open in the current workspace are available in the SQL Database Projects view by default.**  

You can manually add and remove projects from a workspace through the interface in the **Projects** pane. The settings for a workspace can be manually edited in the `.code-workspace` file,  if necessary.

In the following example `.code-workspace` file, the `folders` array lists all folders included in the Explorer pane and the `dataworkspace.excludedProjects` array within `settings` lists all the SQL projects excluded from the **Projects** pane.

```json
{
	"folders": [
		{
			"path": "."
		},
		{
			"name": "WideWorldImportersDW",
			"path": "..\\WideWorldImportersDW"
		}
	],
	"settings": {
		"dataworkspace.excludedProjects": [
			"AdventureWorksLT.sqlproj"
		]
	}
}
```
