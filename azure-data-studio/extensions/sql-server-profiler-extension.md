# SQL Server Profiler extension (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [azure-data-studio-deprecation](../includes/azure-data-studio-deprecation.md)]

The SQL Server Profiler extension (preview) provides a simple SQL Server tracing solution similar to [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) Profiler](/sql/tools/sql-server-profiler/sql-server-profiler) except built using [Extended Events](/sql/relational-databases/extended-events/extended-events). SQL Server Profiler is easy to use and has good default values for the most common tracing configurations. The UX is optimized for browsing through events and viewing the associated Transact-SQL (T-SQL) text. The SQL Server Profiler for Azure Data Studio also assumes good default values for collecting T-SQL execution activities with an easy to use UX. This extension is currently in preview.

**Common SQL Profiler use-cases:**

- Stepping through problem queries to find the cause of the problem.
- Finding and diagnosing slow-running queries.
- Capturing the series of Transact-SQL statements that lead to a problem.
- Monitoring the performance of SQL Server to tune workloads.
- Correlating performance counters to diagnose problems.
- Opening an existing XEL file for review.
