# Schema Compare extension

[!INCLUDE [azure-data-studio-deprecation](../includes/azure-data-studio-deprecation.md)]

This article provides an overview of the Schema Compare extension for Azure Data Studio. The Schema Compare extension provides an easy-to-use way to compare two database definitions and apply the differences from the source to the target.  This includes active database connections, dacpac files, and [SQL projects](sql-database-project-extension.md).

It can be tedious to manually manage and synchronize different database versions. The Schema Compare extension simplifies the process of comparing databases and gives you full control when synchronizing them - you can selectively filter specific differences and categories of differences before applying any changes. The Schema Compare extension is a reliable tool that saves you time and code.

## Features

The Schema Compare extension provides the following features: 

* Compare schemas between two dacpac files, databases, or SQL projects.
* View results as a set of actions to take against the target for it to match the source.
* Selectively exclude actions listed in results.
* Set options that control the scope of the comparison.
* Apply changes directly to the target or generate a script to apply changes at a later time. 
* Save the comparison.
