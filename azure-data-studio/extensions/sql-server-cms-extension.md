# SQL Server Central Management Servers extension (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [azure-data-studio-deprecation](../includes/azure-data-studio-deprecation.md)]

The Central Management Servers extension allows users to store a list of instances of SQL Server that is organized into one or more groups. Actions that are taken using a CMS group act on all servers in the server group.

This experience is currently in its initial preview. Report issues and feature requests [here](https://github.com/microsoft/azuredatastudio/issues).
