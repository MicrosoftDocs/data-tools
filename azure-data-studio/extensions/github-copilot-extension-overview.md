## How GitHub Copilot works

GitHub Copilot works by utilizing advanced machine learning models trained on a vast dataset of publicly available code from GitHub repositories. As you type code, the AI analyzes the context and provides relevant suggestions in real-time. You can receive suggestions also by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do.

The GitHub Copilot extension in [!INCLUDE [azure-data-studio-short](../includes/azure-data-studio-short.md)] uses context from the editor to provide suggestions. For example, if you're writing a query that joins two tables, GitHub Copilot suggests the join condition from columns in the open editor, other files in the workspace, and common syntax patterns.

## Privacy

Your code is yours. We follow responsible practices in accordance with our [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) to ensure that your code snippets aren't used as suggested code for other users of GitHub Copilot.
