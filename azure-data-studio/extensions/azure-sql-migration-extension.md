### Set up auto update for the extension

[!INCLUDE [auto-update-extension](includes/auto-update-extension.md)]

### [Disconnected mode](#tab/disconnected)

### Download installation files

To install the Azure SQL migration extension on a disconnected computer, you must manually download [!INCLUDE [azure-data-studio-short](../includes/azure-data-studio-short.md)], the Azure SQL migration extension VSIX file, and the SQL tool service binaries, on a machine connected to the Internet, and then copy the file to the disconnect machine.

1. Download [!INCLUDE [azure-data-studio-short](../includes/azure-data-studio-short.md)] for the disconnected machine, from [Download and install Azure Data Studio](../download-azure-data-studio.md), and take note of the platform.

1. Download the latest Azure SQL migration extension VSIX file from the following location: [https://sqlopsextensions.blob.core.windows.net/extensions/sql-migration/sql-migration-1.5.4.vsix](https://sqlopsextensions.blob.core.windows.net/extensions/sql-migration/sql-migration-1.5.4.vsix).

   > [!NOTE]  
   > You can change the version number, which is `1.5.4` in this example, if you download a later version.

1. Download the required SQL tool service binaries. Follow this step after you install the Azure SQL migration extension on your disconnected machine.

   1. On the disconnected machine, open the following path:

      ```output
      %USERPROFILE%\.azuredatastudio\extensions\microsoft.sql-migration-1.5.4
      ```

      > [!NOTE]  
      > You can change the version number, which is `1.5.4` in this example, if you download a later version.

   1. Open the `config.json` file to find the version number for SQL tool service binaries to be downloaded. For example:

      ```json
      "version": "4.12.0.4"
      ```

   1. Visit the releases tab of the GitHub repository using this version number. For example, <https://github.com/microsoft/sqltoolsservice/releases/tag/4.12.0.4>.

   1. Depending upon the disconnected machine platform, download the `Microsoft.SqlTools.Migration` zip file. For example:

      - For 64-bit Windows (x64), download the file named `Microsoft.SqlTools.Migration-win-x64-net7.0.zip`
      - For 32-bit Windows (x86), download the file named `Microsoft.SqlTools.Migration-win-x86-net7.0.zip`

### Install Azure Data Studio and Azure SQL migration extension offline

1. Copy the three files you downloaded, to the disconnected machine where you want to run [!INCLUDE [azure-data-studio-short](../includes/azure-data-studio-short.md)].

1. Install [!INCLUDE [azure-data-studio-short](../includes/azure-data-studio-short.md)].

1. To install the Azure SQL migration extension, open [!INCLUDE [azure-data-studio-short](../includes/azure-data-studio-short.md)] and navigate to **File** > **Install Extension from VSIX package**. Locate the VSIX file you copied to the disconnected machine.

1. On the disconnected machine, navigate to the following path:

   ```output
   %USERPROFILE%\.azuredatastudio\extensions\microsoft.sql-migration-1.5.4
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > You can change the version number, which is `1.5.4` in this example, if you download a later version.

1. Create folders in the path to add the following subdirectories: `\migrationService\windows\4.12.0.4\`. Your folder structure should look similar to the following example:

   ```output
   %USERPROFILE%\.azuredatastudio\extensions\microsoft.sql-migration-1.5.4\migrationService\Windows\4.12.0.4
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > You can change both the version number (which is `4.12.0.4` in this example) and platform (which is `windows` in this example), to match the version and platform downloaded the previous steps.

1. Extract the zipped `Microsoft.SqlTools.Migration` file under the above mentioned path.

1. Restart [!INCLUDE [azure-data-studio-short](../includes/azure-data-studio-short.md)].

## Features

### Azure SQL target readiness assessment and database migrations

The Azure SQL migration extension supports assessment and generates Azure recommendations (Preview) and database migrations for the following Azure SQL targets.

- SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines
- Azure SQL Managed Instance
- Azure SQL Database

#### View precomputed Arc assessments and track migration

If your SQL Server instance is Arc enabled and the migration assessment is already computed, the SQL migration extension in Azure Data Studio fetches the precomputed assessment and SKU recommendation from Arc and populates it in the Assessments wizard. The extension also updates the latest migration status in the Arc resource of the SQL Server instance. You can track the progress in the built-in [Database migration](/sql/sql-server/azure-arc/migrate-to-azure-sql-managed-instance) experience. 

If your SQL Server instance is not enabled by Azure Arc, the SQL migration extension creates a free and optional SQL Server instance Azure resource to track migration process at no additional cost. Select the *Subscription*, *Resource Group* and *Location* where you want to create the tracking Azure resource. Registering your subscription to the `Microsoft.AzureArcData` resource provider is a prerequisite to creating the Azure resource. If your subscription is not already registered, an attempt is made to register the subscription with the resource provider on your behalf. If you do not have permission to register the resource provider, creating the resource in Azure is skipped. 

### Migration modes

The following migration modes are supported for the corresponding Azure SQL targets.

| Migration mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Online** | The source SQL Server database is available for reading and writing activity, while database backups are continuously restored on target Azure SQL. Application downtime is limited to the duration of the cutover at the end of migration. |
| **Offline** | The source database can't be used for writing activity while backup files are restored on the target Azure SQL database. Application downtime persists from the start until the completion of the migration process. |

### Support matrix

| Azure SQL target | Migration mode |
