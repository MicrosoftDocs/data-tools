# Manage packages in database with Machine Learning extension for Azure Data Studio (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [azure-data-studio-deprecation](../includes/azure-data-studio-deprecation.md)]

Learn how to manage Python or R packages in your database with the [Machine Learning extension for Azure Data Studio](machine-learning-extension.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Manage packages in database with the Machine Learning extension currently only supports [Machine Learning Services](/sql/machine-learning/sql-server-machine-learning-services) on SQL Server 2019.

## Prerequisites

- Install and configure [Machine Learning extension for Azure Data Studio](machine-learning-extension.md). You need to specify the [Python or R installation paths in the Extension Settings](machine-learning-extension.md#settings) for the package management to work.

- The **sqlmlutils** package. If the package is not already installed, the Machine Learning extension will prompt you to install this.

- For SQL Server on Linux, Windows authentication is not supported. Therefore, you need to use SQL authentication to connect to your SQL Server on Linux.

## Manage Python packages

You can install and uninstall Python packages with the Machine Learning extension.

### Install new Python package
