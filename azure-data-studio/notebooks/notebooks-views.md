# Notebook views (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [azure-data-studio-deprecation](../includes/azure-data-studio-deprecation.md)]

Notebook Views is ideal for consumers of notebook results such as data analysis outcomes. Notebook authors can hide complexities and select the cells that are relevant for consumers.

One notebook can have multiple views and work for any kernel.

Notebook Views is now available in [Azure Data Studio](../download-azure-data-studio.md), starting with the October 2021 release (1.33.0).

[!INCLUDE [azure-data-studio-preview](../includes/azure-data-studio-preview.md)]

## Get started

1. Enable Notebook Views from Settings.

2. Go to **Settings**, then search for `notebook view`. Ensure that **Notebook Views: Enabled** is selected.

3. In an existing notebook, select **Editor** and choose **Create New View**.

Now you can see that all the cells (both text and code cells) have been added to the View canvas.

## Resize, move, and delete cells

From here, you can delete, resize, and move the cells from the view.

:::image type="content" source="media/notebooks-views/notebooks-views-plotly.png" alt-text="Resize":::

- To delete, select the cell and select the **Delete** button on top of the cell (circle 1 in the screenshot).
- To resize, select the cell and hover to the bottom-right corner (circle 2 of the screenshot), and your cursor should be in resize mode.
- To move, select the cell and drag the cell to the desired location.
- To run the cell only, select the cell to activate the cell, then select the **Run** button from the top menu (circle 1 of the screenshot).

> [!Note]
> If the cell in the notebook has dependencies on the previous cells, this might result in an error.

## Insert and run all cell views

:::image type="content" source="media/notebooks-views/notebooks-views-insert-cells.png" alt-text="Insert Cells":::

- To add new cells, select the **Insert Cells** button on the top right of the Editor view.
- To refresh the view, select **Run All**. This runs all the cells in the notebook, in the background, even if they aren't on the view itself.

## Manage views
